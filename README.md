### What is this repository for? ###

1. This is a portefolio repo to allow external peek into some of my data analytic and reporting skills with Python.
2. This repo includes a Jupyter Lab Notebooks.
    - SHe_UserSurveyAnalysis.ipynb: Focuses on 4 critical questions to answer in order to support decision making by the Product Management team. I followed a scientific steps style in the analysis and reporting.

### Why are the datasets missing? ###

* Data sets contains personnal information I cannot make public.
* You can still see the Notebook cells as processed by me.

### How do I get set up? ###
